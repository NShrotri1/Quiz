  <h1>OMG - A Quiz!</h1>
  <h2>Top Three CS Things this year</h2>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Developing the concept of abstraction was impactful to me. Abstraction is a general concept which isn't just limited to CS.</li>
  <li>Going deeper into DevTools was another really cool thing for me. DevTools was much more powerful than I first realized.</li>
  <li>Finally, understanding the timeline of the internet was amazing. I had no idea that there were so many innovations that enabled the internet to be what it is today.</li>
